==ASSIGNMENT 1==
Create a laboratory notebook.
Here i used "nano my_weekly_journal.txt, the nano command is used to create, view and edit text files.

==ASSIGNMENT 2==
Tasks
-Find out your current directory
-List the contents of this directory
-Navigate to your home directory
-List the contents again and note the differences
-create a new directory
-navigate into it
-confirm your location.

Task 1
/home/vboxuser/Documents " Documents, I used the 'pwd' (print working directory) which shows my current directory and location.

Task 2
'Linux commands.txt'  'My Books'   my_weekly_journal.txt   Names   okay.txt  - "ls list the contents of directories, and can be paired together with file path (ls /home/vboxuser/Documents) this list the  content of the directory if one isnt in the directory.

Task 3
cd - this command always refers one to ones' home directory anywhere it is inputed.

Task 4
ls

 alphapip.txt   fuck      'linux command (back up).txt'   Pictures    Videos
 Desktop        fuck.txt  'Linux commands.txt'            Public
 Documents      Hello.py  'linux command.txt'             snap
 Downloads      LINUX      Music                          Templates

The contents of my home directory inlcuded subdirectories for pictures, videos, downloads and many more, different from the Documents directory which mainly features .txt file and empty files.

Task 5
mkdir- mkdir task_5

This is actualy beyond the scope of this weeks' lessons so I asked for help from Deepseek.

Task 6
cd task_5

Task 7
/home/vboxuser/task_5

pwd indicated my current location


==ASSIGNMENT 3==
The Security Calculator (linux & python)

Linux
If a server has 16gb of RAM and each user connection uses 512mb how many concurrent connections can it theoretically handle before running out.

Solution
Since 1gb = 1024mb, 
expr 16 \* 1024
16384
expr 16384 / 512
32
therefore the server can handle 32 users concurrently.

Python
Enter the python interractive interface with "python3"
>>> a = 16
>>> b = 1024
>>> c = 512
>>> user = a * b / c
>>> print(user)
32.0

ctrl + d ends python interractive interface.

Rem; I solved a user capacity problem using linux and python and I definitely prefer python, simpler command as i dont have to worry about '\*' which is multiplication in linux.
 
==ASSIGNMENT 4==
Visualizing the CIA triad.

I used figlet and also "-f slant" to create ASCII images of the acronymn CIA.
